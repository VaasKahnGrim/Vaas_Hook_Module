# DESCRIPTION:
A serverside library for use in binary modules. Mainly to provide similar functionality to the lua hook library but for C++ only.
Basically enable/disable/add/remove/call/run/exists. I may also do something along the lines of like having a dedicated folder for modules so that the main module can just load
everything from there and then add every single hook into it. This might evolve into a completely differant project to allow people to do what they have done in lua already but
for C++ serverside. No I will not be making the module check WHAT you try to make with it, that is on you to review what you put on your server, nobody else should be doing that
for you.
